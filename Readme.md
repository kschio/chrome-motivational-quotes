# Motivational Quotes

![Motivational Quotes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mx2e07tnugw4lap/mq-demo-repo.png?dl=0)

When opening a new tab in Chrome the most viewed websites are shown. I never liked the idea of letting everyone see my most viewed websites whenever I open a new tab.

Therefore I created this small new tab extension which shows a random motivational quote instead.

Most importantly this repo serves as some kind of boilerplate to build your own new tab pages with *AngularJS*.

The code used for this plugin is only to show potential use cases and is not optimised at all.

Feel free to use this repo as a starter and go crazy with your own ideas.
